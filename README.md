different piecewise linear tensor fields.

## Components

### parallel_eigenvectors
Main program. Computes parallel eigenvectors on a VTK Unstructured grid file.
Execute `parallel_eigenvectors -h` for valid command line options. Input file
needs to be in VTK legacy format with two different PointData tensors (arrays
with 9 components containing 3x3 tensor in row-major order).

The main algorithm is implemented in `src/ParallelEigenvectors.cc` and does
not depend on VTK. A VTK filter using the algorithm to find PEV points on
tetrahedral cell faces and connecting them to lines is implemented in
`src/vtkParallelEigenvectors.cc`.

### generate_tet_dataset
Small tool to generate example datasets. Execute `generate_tet_dataset -h` for
valid command line options. Generates a mesh in tetrahedral form with variable
number of subdivision levels. Tensors at the four corners can be specified
manually or randomly. Subdivision interpolates linearly between the corners.
